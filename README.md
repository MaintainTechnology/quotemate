# QuoteMate

> AI-powered quoting for trade businesses. Turn a phone call or a photo into a professional quote in minutes — not on Sunday night.

QuoteMate is a mobile-first quoting tool built for residential trade owner-operators (plumbers, electricians, carpenters, painters, landscapers) in the AU/NZ market. It combines an AI receptionist that captures jobs over the phone, an AI engine that drafts professional quotes from the intake, and a customer-facing portal that takes deposits the moment the quote is accepted.

The goal is simple: **reclaim the evenings tradies currently lose to admin, and stop wasting trips on jobs that were never going to convert.**

## The problem

Tradies don't lose money on jobs — they lose it *between* jobs:

- Phone tag and notepad chaos while on the tools
- Sunday-night quote writing in Word or Excel
- Re-quoting jobs that ghost (industry average: 30–50% of quotes never become work)
- Driving to free site visits for jobs that were never a real fit
- Customers shopping the quote against two others and never replying

Existing job-management tools (ServiceM8, Tradify, AroFlo) handle scheduling and invoicing well, but the **intake → quote** moment is still mostly manual. QuoteMate is built around that moment.

## What QuoteMate does

1. **Captures the job for you** — a dedicated AI receptionist answers the call and asks the right job-specific questions. The moment the call ends, the customer gets an SMS with a one-tap link to add photos — optional, races the quote draft, lifts confidence when it arrives.
2. **Drafts the quote** — an AI engine generates a structured quote (scope, line items, labour, materials, exclusions, risks) using the tradie's own pricing book and prior quote history.
3. **Routes by confidence** — high-confidence jobs go straight to the customer; medium ones wait for a quick tradie review; complex ones trigger a paid site inspection.
4. **Sends a polished customer experience** — mobile-first, branded quote with Good / Better / Best options and a one-tap deposit button.
5. **Closes the loop** — availability nudges, SMS follow-ups, calendar booking on accept.

## How it works

### Two flows, one engine

QuoteMate routes every job into one of two paths based on whether the tradie can quote it remotely.

**Standard flow** — the tradie reviews the AI-drafted quote, edits if needed, sends it to the customer, and the customer accepts and pays a deposit through the portal. The flow ends with the job confirmed and on the calendar.

**Inspection flow** — when remote scoping isn't enough, the tradie creates a paid site-visit request. The customer pays a $199 inspection fee (refundable on accepted quote), the tradie attends in person, then completes the full quote in QuoteMate before rejoining the standard send/accept/deposit path.

The full flow is mapped here:

### The "wow moment" experience

The customer-facing experience is designed around one outcome — the call ends with the customer feeling they're already in good hands, and the tradie wakes up the next morning to a draft they only need to tweak.

### High-level architecture

```
Customer call
   ↓
AI Receptionist (voice agent)
   ↓
Intake Engine        → scope, photos, address, urgency, confidence score
   ↓
Estimation Engine    → scope of works + labour + materials + risks
   ↓
Confidence-based routing
   ├─ HIGH:    auto-quote sent to customer
   ├─ MEDIUM:  tradie validates, then sends
   └─ LOW:     paid site-visit triggered
   ↓
Mobile customer portal (Good / Better / Best + deposit)
   ↓
Availability nudge → Follow-up engine → Job won → Calendar + CRM
```

## Roadmap

The build is planned in five phases over roughly six months to a paid launch with a small cohort of pilot tradies.

| Phase | Focus | Exit criterion |
|---|---|---|
| **0 — Validate** (2 wks) | Customer interviews, pricing-test on the $199 inspection fee, pre-sell pilots | ≥5 paid pilot commitments |
| **1 — Tradie portal MVP** (4 wks) | Manual intake, AI quote draft, customer portal, Stripe deposit. *No voice agent yet.* | 3 pilot tradies, ≥5 real quotes each, ≥1 paid |
| **2 — Pricing intelligence + inspection** (4 wks) | Pricing-book ingestion, RAG, confidence scoring, paid site-visit flow, Good / Better / Best | Avg tradie editing time < 3 min/quote |
| **3 — Voice intake** (6 wks) | Vapi receptionist, per-trade prompts, mid-call SMS photo capture, post-call quote draft | 80% of calls produce a quote draft sent with < 5 min editing |
| **4 — Conversion engine** (4 wks) | Availability nudge, SMS follow-up, calendar integration, basic CRM | +15% win-rate lift vs Phase 3 baseline |
| **5 — Launch** | 50 tradies in the wedge segment, high-touch onboarding, second trade added | — |

**Initial wedge:** **electrical, NSW, residential.** Single trade keeps the pricing book + assembly library focused before going broad. v1 scope is the "easy 5" job types — downlights, GPOs, ceiling fans, smoke alarms, outdoor / deck lighting. Switchboards, fault finding, EV chargers, underground cabling, and complex renovations are inspection-route only (never auto-quoted in v1). Per-state license display (NECA/ESV/QBCC) is shipped Phase 1. See [`docs/strategy.md`](docs/strategy.md) v3 entry for the rationale behind the painting → electrical pivot.
