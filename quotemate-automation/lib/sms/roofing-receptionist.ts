// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// SMS roofing receptionist — pure per-turn decision.
//
// Given the conversation's persisted roofing state (gathered slots, the
// step we last asked about, any pending measured quote awaiting
// confirmation) plus the customer's new message, decide the turn:
//   • cancel     — customer asked to stop / cancel (checked FIRST).
//   • ask        — fold the answer in, send the next question.
//   • measure    — enough gathered → run measureAndPriceRoofs, then send
//                  the roof image link and ask "is this your roof?".
//   • inspection — gathered but material/pitch forces an on-site visit.
//   • send_saved — customer confirmed the building → send the saved quote
//                  (optionally for one picked structure). Terminal.
//   • reconfirm  — reply to the photo wasn't clear → re-ask.
//   • booking    — reply to "shall we book the inspection?". Terminal.
//
// Once a flow is closed (quote sent / cancelled / booked), an unrelated
// message never re-quotes; only a fresh roofing enquiry reopens it.
//
// The route does the I/O (measure, persist, SMS); this module is pure so
// the conversation logic is fully unit-tested.
