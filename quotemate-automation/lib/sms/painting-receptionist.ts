// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// SMS painting receptionist — pure per-turn decision.
//
// Given the conversation's persisted painting state (gathered slots + the
// step we last asked about) plus the customer's new message, decide the
// turn:
//   • cancel     — customer asked to stop / cancel (checked FIRST).
//   • offer_form — opener: offer the self-serve form link FIRST. The route
//                  mints the per-request token and composes the message
//                  ("fill this in, or reply here and I'll ask a few
//                  questions").
//   • await_form — customer chose the form → acknowledge and wait. The
//                  form POST produces the quote out-of-band ("your quote is
//                  on its way"); a later text switches them to Q&A.
//   • ask        — fold the answer in, send the next question (dropdown
//                  options are inlined in the question text by the intake).
//   • estimate   — enough gathered cleanly → run estimatePainting + send.
//   • inspection — a customer-declared trigger (poor substrate / raked
//                  ceiling / 3+ storeys) forces an on-site visit.
//   • booking    — reply to "shall we book the inspection?". Terminal.
//   • passthrough— a warm 'quoted' thread got an unrelated message → hand
//                  it back to the general dialog (the route returns false).
//
// The route does the I/O (mint token, run estimate, persist, send SMS);
// this module is pure so the conversation logic is fully unit-tested.
// Mirrors lib/sms/roofing-receptionist.ts.
