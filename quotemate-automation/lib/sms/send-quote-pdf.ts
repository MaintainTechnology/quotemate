// Shared "send a quote SMS, attach its PDF as a best-effort MMS" glue.
//
// Every trade's customer-quote send repeats the same tail:
//   1. a PDF was (maybe) rendered → a storage path, or null
//   2. the SMS body already carries the durable PDF download link
//   3. sign a SHORT-LIVED public URL for the Twilio MMS media fetch —
//      best-effort: a signing failure must NOT block the SMS
//   4. dispatch, letting dispatchQuoteMessage drop the media to a plain
//      SMS if the carrier rejects the MMS (AU long codes routinely do)
//
// Copy-pasting that tail across estimate/draft, approve, edit, roofing and
// the plan estimator is how solar silently shipped with NO MMS at all. This
// helper is the single chokepoint so a new trade inherits the behaviour by
// construction. The body link itself stays caller-built (it's woven into
// trade-specific copy) via the pure *PdfUrl() helpers.
//
// Bucket-agnostic: the caller injects the signer (signQuotePdfUrl for the
// quote-pdfs bucket, signPlanPdfUrl for plan-pdfs).

// RC-7 — Twilio's hard MMS media limit. The canonical stored quote PDF is now
// the FULL-image document (so dashboard-download + the /api/q/[token]/pdf link
// show every logo/aerial, matching the live preview). An oversized PDF must
// NOT be attached as MMS media: Twilio ACCEPTS the send synchronously and only
// fails delivery asynchronously, so dispatch's synchronous MMS→SMS fallback
// never fires and the customer gets a broken/empty MMS. Instead the MMS signer
// throws for an over-cap PDF, dispatchQuoteWithPdf degrades to a plain SMS, and
// the body's durable link still serves the SAME full PDF.

// and never reaches 'delivered' — so the customer loses the ENTIRE message,
// body and all, not just the attachment. Two roofing quotes were lost this
// way while every media-free SMS on the same thread delivered fine.

// The body always carries a durable "PDF copy: …" link, so the attachment
