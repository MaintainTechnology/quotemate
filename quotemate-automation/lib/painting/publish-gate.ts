// Painting — the tradie-release gate (mirrors lib/solar/publish.ts).
//
// ⚠ Since spec painting-auto-send (docs/strategy.md v21) NO origin drafts a
// held priced row any more: SMS/self-serve leads are released at save time
// like dashboard saves always were, so a priced quote shows immediately.
// These predicates are UNCHANGED and still load-bearing — an unreleased row
// (a legacy held draft, or one whose customer send failed and was rolled
// back) must still be withheld, which is exactly what they do.
//
// canShowPaintingPrices gates the /q/paint/[token] page; paintingRelease
// Eligibility makes the release idempotent (a second Send is a no-op).
// ⚠ paintingDepositLocked is now UNUSED BY /r/paint — since spec
// painting-site-visit-first the route's release gate is resolvePaintMintTier
// (lib/painting/pay-redirect.ts), which admits the $99 site visit on a
// released ∨ inspection-routed row and 302s a held one back to the quote
// page. The helper is kept for its remaining callers/tests.
//
// PURE — no I/O. Fully unit-testable.
